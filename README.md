🤖 Multi-Modal Attribute Prediction System


## 📌 Project Overview

The Multi-Modal Attribute Prediction System is a Streamlit-based AI application that performs multiple human and object attribute predictions using images, videos, audio, and real-time camera input.

This project integrates Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Audio Processing, and Rule-Based Logic into a single unified interface with 7 functional modules (tabs).

This project focuses on:

*Efficient document preprocessing

*Robust feature engineering

*Optimal model selection for different prediction tasks

*Integration of multiple predictive models into a single system

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing (Used Across Modules)
🔹 Image Preprocessing

Convert to NumPy array

Resize to model-specific input size (64×64, 224×224, 227×227)

Normalize pixel values (/255.0)

Expand dimensions for batch input

🔹 Audio Preprocessing

WAV file input

MFCC feature extraction using extract_mfcc

Reshape features for ML models

🔹 Video Preprocessing

Frame-by-frame extraction using OpenCV

Temporary file handling using tempfile

Real-time frame processing

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

🖼️ Image Features

Face region extraction using Haar Cascade / DNN

CNN-based feature extraction

HSV color space analysis (car color detection)

Pixel intensity averaging (dress color detection)

🔊 Audio Features

MFCC coefficients

Temporal audio features flattened into vectors

🎥 Video Features

Object bounding boxes (YOLO)

Frame-level attribute aggregation

## 🧠 Model Selection & Logic

🔹 Models Used

Module	Model
Age & Gender	Caffe DNN
Hair Detection	CNN (Keras .keras)
Senior Citizen	Caffe DNN
Voice Analysis	Keras (.h5)
Sign Language	CNN
Car Detection	YOLOv8
Nationality	CNN

## 🧩 Application Modules (Tabs)

🧑 Tab 1: Age & Gender Detection

Face detection using OpenCV DNN

Age classification into predefined buckets

Gender classification (Male/Female)

Output:
Age group + Gender + annotated image

💇 Tab 2: Long Hair Prediction with Gender Logic

CNN predicts Long / Short Hair

Random ML-based age & gender fallback

Rule Applied:

Age 20–30 → Hair overrides gender

Else → ML gender result

🧓 Tab 3: Senior Citizen Detection

Camera or video input

Face detection + age estimation

If age ≥ 40 → flagged as senior citizen

Logs results to CSV with timestamp

🎧 Tab 4: Voice-Based Age & Emotion Detection

MFCC feature extraction

Gender validation

Age prediction

Emotion detection for senior citizens

🧏 Tab 5: Sign Language Detection (ASL)

CNN-based alphabet classification (A–Z)

Image upload + camera support

Time-restricted access (6 PM – 10 PM)

🚦 Tab 6: Car Color & People Detection

YOLOv8 object detection

Car vs Person classification

HSV-based blue car detection

Supports image and video input

🌍 Tab 7: Nationality-Aware Face Analysis

Nationality prediction

Emotion recognition

Conditional predictions:

Indian → Age + Dress Color

US → Age

African → Dress Color

## 📊 Output & Visualization

Bounding boxes and labels

Confidence scores

CSV logging for senior citizens
